## Machine Learning project for DSF Hackathon

"Generate an ML algorithm (preferably python based) to predict how a DSF project will end, given the current delivery parameters. It should be a predictive model generating a RAG – Red, Amber & Green status (with reason). The teams will be supplied with delivery parameters (as captured in JIRA) in excel format of anonymized projects (training data). Evaluation will be done on a different set of project list with same parameters."

This project automates the end-to-end machine learning workflow from data ingestion to transformation to model training and predictions.

**1. Overview :**
    The goal is to predict project progress or RAG status(Red, Amber and Green) based on the project metadata that is fetched from JIRA.

**2. Pipleline Architecture :**
    Raw CSV → Data Ingestion (src/components/data_ingestion.py) → Data Transformation (src/components/data_transformation.py) → Model Training (src/components/model_trainer.py) → Prediction (with Reasons) (src/pipeline/predict_pipeline.py)

**3. How to Run :**
    # Step 1: Create environment 
    conda create -p venv python=3.8 -y 
    conda activate venv/ 
    
    # Step 2: Install dependencies 
    pip install -r requirements.txt 
    
    # Step 3: Run the pipeline 
    python src/components/data_ingestion.py

**4. Output Artifacts :**
